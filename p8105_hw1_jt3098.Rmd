```{r library, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r random_sample}
set.seed(10)
rsample <- runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)
vec_logic <- rsample > 2
char_vec <- vector(mode = "character", length = 10)
fac_vec <- factor(x = character(10))

data_frame <- tibble(
  rsample,
  vec_logic,
  char_vec,
  fac_vec
)
```

```{r mean}
mean(rsample)
mean(vec_logic)
mean(char_vec)
mean(fac_vec)
```

the mean of rsample and vec_logic work, but the mean of char_vec and fac_vec do not work, possibly because taking mean requires that each variable cannot be null.
